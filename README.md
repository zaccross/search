# Pac-Mac Search Project for CIS 571 at the University of Oregon

In this project, I code a variety of search algorithms that enable the pac-man agent to find its way through a variety of mazes.

This project comes from the Berkley CS188 AI class, and more information can be found [here](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html)

IMPORTANT NOTE: I did not create / code most of the files in this repository. For the project, I edited search.py and searchAgents.py

This was a fun project, and a great introduction to uninformed, and informed heuristic search!
